# ‚ôüÔ∏è Mahmoud Chess Engine v1.0

A neural network‚Äìpowered chess engine that selects moves using a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on game outcomes. This project is a demonstration of a **purely supervised learning approach** to chess AI and is **open for collaboration**!

## üß† Approach: Pure Supervised Learning

- **Data Preparation:**  
  Positions are extracted from real chess games (PGN files) and encoded as 8x8x12 tensors. Each position is labeled with the final game result (1 for White win, 0 for Black win).

- **Model Architecture:**  
  A CNN predicts the probability that White will win from any given position. The model is trained with binary cross-entropy loss using only the final outcome as the label.

- **Move Selection:**  
  For every legal move, the engine simulates the move, encodes the resulting board, and uses the neural network to estimate the win probability for White. The move with the highest (or lowest, for Black) predicted probability is chosen.

- **No Search or Lookahead:**  
  The engine does **not** perform any tree search or tactical lookahead. It relies entirely on the neural net‚Äôs evaluation of single positions.

## üö© Limitations

- **No Tactical Awareness:**  
  The model often misses tactics and forced mates, since it does not search ahead or learn tactical motifs directly.

- **Shallow Pattern Recognition:**  
  The network learns surface-level features (material, king safety) but struggles with deep strategy or combinations unless they are strongly correlated with game outcomes in the data.

- **Label Ambiguity:**  
  Using only the final game result as a label introduces noise, especially in positions that are unclear or in draw.

## üî≠ Future Plans

- **Integrate Search Algorithms:**  
  Combine the neural network with a search algorithm (e.g., minimax or alpha-beta) to evaluate move sequences, not just single positions.

- **Self-Play and Reinforcement Learning:**  
  Explore reinforcement learning to allow the engine to learn from its own games, not just static labels.

- **Model Architecture Enhancements:**  
  Experiment with deeper or more specialized neural network architectures.
